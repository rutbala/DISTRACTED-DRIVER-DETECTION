# DISTRACTED-DRIVER-DETECTION

Introduction:-

In this project, I developed a Deep Learning Classification model capable of detecting driver behavior from images captured by dashboard cameras in automobiles.
The model indicates whether the driver is:
   1. Driving cautiously and paying attention to the road. 
   2. Using mobile phone.
   3. Distracted by doing other activities like operating the radio, drinking etc.
      
Distracted driving results in numerous collisions, injuries, and fatalities. Our primary objective is to enhance road safety by employing technology to identify drivers who are distracted. To train the model, we provided it with a dataset containing various actions of the driver. After that, we evaluated the application to ensure optimal functionality. If effective, this might help improve road safety and save lives by reducing the occurrence of accidents involving distracted drivers.

Dataset:-

Kaggle, an online platform for data science competitions, offers datasets for cutting-edge algorithmic challenges in sectors less exposed to AI advancements. It provides a platform to understand datasets deeply and offers opportunities like internships and awards for students. We utilize a dataset from a completed State Farm challenge, which includes hundreds of images depicting various actions performed by multiple individuals.
